> My Physics Degree thesis

An introduction to quantum computing and the quantum circuit model is given. Three quantum algorithms (Grover's Algorithm, Counting Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm) are discussed and simulated using Python coding and Qiskit libraries. Simulation results are discussed and compared with theoretical expectations.
