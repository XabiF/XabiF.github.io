I'm currently on an internship in Ayesa (I3B), finishing my master's thesis (MSc in Quantum Science and Technology at UPV/EHU) about [**Quantum Computation of Fluid Dynamics**](https://github.com/XabiF/tfm-qcfd-qubo-hhl), researching numerical simulations of fluids through QUBO formulations and using the HHL algorithm.

I'm also slowly reverse-engineering and decompiling the **Super Scribblenauts** Nintendo DS game, function by function (which is going to take a while) as well as maintaining [my existing homebrew projects](/other).
