Looks like you found my personal website...

I'm a quantum physicist who also enjoys reverse-engineering from time to time. I've learned all programming I know by toying around with Nintendo homebrew software throughout the years, and now I enjoy using those skills everywhere.

Go ahead, look up whatever you wish about my work and/or interests ;)
